# Turbo Git

This CLI tool was originally thought for implementing the [Turbo Commit Convention](/CONVENTION.md) easily. Now It's more than that.. You can use it with any other commit convention just choosing one with an utility command. And it's also good for tuning out of the box git commands.

If you enjoy the good quality software and you work hard for have it, You'll enjoy using a commit convention on your projects that ensures readability and understanding. You can also make some greats improvements on how you use git in the command line everyday.
Wouldn't it be great to have a tool that ensure all of this for you and for your team?

## Commit Conventions

If you want **Turbo Git** allows you work with any other commit convention. We provide some of them with the `turbo init` command and you can create one by your own in an easy way. You are able also to use different conventions per git repository that's what the  **.turbogit** file exactly does. You can create the **.turbogit** as follow:
```
git turbo init
```
or just
```
git ti
```
You will see the following options:

- Turbo Commit
- Angular
- Open UI5
- Custom

You can choose whatever you want.. and this init command will create a **.turbogit** file on your repo.
The **.turbogit** file.. It's just a json that you can easilly edit to your needs. 

> The Custom option is not doing to much at the moment. It's just creating the **.turbogit** file with some explanations about how to edit it.


## Coming soon

- Turbo changelog command, for autogenerate changelogs based on any commit convention.

- Improvements in the existing turbo commands adding functionalitty and a beter UX.

- We'll continue working on add new **turbo-commands** that will have some extra magic, any idea/help is welcome.
